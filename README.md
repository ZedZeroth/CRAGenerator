# CRAGenerator
Generates customer risk assessments (CRAs)

## 0. Intro

For this project I hope to implement Domain Driven Design architecture and SOLID principles. The scripts generate risk assessments for each customer based on their identity and trade data. Currently it only pulls some basic customer/trade/payment data and generates a signle risk score. Data is currently stored in CSV files but will eventually be migrated onto a database. I am using PHPUnit for testing and PHPCS for styling.

## 1. Domains

#### 1.1. Customers

Properties represent the identity data for each customer. They are also assigned an array of their "Trades" and their risk "Assessments". Their risk assessments will eventually be viewable via HTML generated by the UserInterface Layer.

#### 1.2. Trades (effectively "orders" or "purchases/sales")

Properties represent transcational data. Each trade contains its corresponding "Payment(s)".

#### 1.3. Payments (bank transfer data)

Mapped from the transaction data of each payment.

#### 1.4. (Risk) Assessments

A series of risk scores generated for each customer from all of the above data.

## 2. Layers (within each domain)

### 2.1. Core Layer

#### 2.1.1. BusinessLogic ("domain" or "model" layer)

Within each domain the BusinessLogic folder contains the model class, its factory, and any "horizontal" cross-domain services for the models to interact with other models in other domains (e.g. The AssignTradesService represents the Customer domain interacting with the Trade domain).

### 2.2. Application Layers

#### 2.2.1. UserInterface ("client" or "presentation" layer) [not yet implemented]

Classes for user interactions and any services for interacting with the BusinessLogic core. This includes the generator of HTML representations of each customer's risk assessment/scores.

#### 2.2.2. DataAccess ("persistence" layer)

Classes for reading/writing from the CSV files and any services for interacting with the BusinessLogic core. Currently this includes a DTO class and adapters for converting data in different CSVs into a universal DTO that is used to build the BusinessLogic layer's model properties.

## 3. Infrastructure

This folder contains any "horizontal" cross-domain / systemwide interfaces or services that are not restricted to a single domain.
