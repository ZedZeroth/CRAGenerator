# CRAGenerator
Generates customer risk assessments (CRAs)

## Intro

For this project I hope to implement Domain Driven Design architecture and SOLID principles. The scripts generate risk assessments for each customer based on their identity and trade data.

## Domains

There are currently two domains: Customers and Trades.  
Two more domains will be added: Payments and Assessments.

### Customers

Properties represent the identity data for each customer. They are also assigned an array of their Trades and their Risk Assessments. Their risk assessments will eventually be viewable via HTML generated by the UserInterface Layer.

### Trades

Properties represent transcational data. Each trade contains its corresponding Payment.

### Payments

Mapped from the transaction data of each payment.

### Assessments

Generated for each customer from all of the above.

## Layers

### Core Layer

#### BusinessLogic  

Within each domain the BusinessLogic folder contains the model class, its factory, and any "horizontal" cross-domain services for the models to interact with other models (e.g. Customers interacting with Trades).

### Application Layers

#### UserInterface

#### DataAcces

#### Testing

## Infrastructure

This folder conatins any:
1. "horizontal" inter-domain interfaces
2. "vertical" inter-layer services
